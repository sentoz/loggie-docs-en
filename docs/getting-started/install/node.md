# Host deployment
 
Loggie uses Golang to be compiled into binary, and can be deployed to various systems according to needs.
Here we provide a reference for deploying Loggie using systemd.

## Pre-check
- Operating System: Linux
- System Architecture: amd64
- Distribution supports systemd

The current release only contains binary executables generated by GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64. For other systems and architectures, please cross-compile based on the source code.

## Download Binary

```
VERSION=v1.5.0
mkdir /opt/loggie && curl https://github.com/loggie-io/loggie/releases/download/${VERSION}/loggie-linux-amd64 -o /opt/loggie/loggie && chmod +x /opt/loggie/loggie
```

Please replace `<VERSION>` above with the specific version number.
